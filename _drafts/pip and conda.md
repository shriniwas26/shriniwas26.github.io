So, I perfectly expect to write a followup to this once I understand how conda works. 

## Installing Python and Pip
- Go to [python.org](python.org)
- Download the recommended version for Windows.
- Make sure you check off the option to 'add .exe to path'. Choosing that option will enable you access python from any command line.
- Click *Next* until the program is completely installed.
- To verify your install, open command line and run the command `python` 
[]!(Add picture)
- If you get an error like this, locate your downloaded executable file, left-click to run the file but this time, choose the *Modify* option and make sure to check off the option *Add to Path*
- Close and re-open command line and run `python` again on command line.
## Deleting Python from your Machine 
- Go to Apps and find Python and Pip and uninstall
- Also go to the location where it was installed and delete 
- 
## Installing other packages/libraries
With the python installation, you also by default have the *pip*. More on pip [here](add link). To install packages, simply go to command line and type `pip install pandas` or `pip install numpy` or `pip install notebook` in the case of Jupyter notebook.

To start Jupyter notebook, go to command line and run  `python -m notebook`
